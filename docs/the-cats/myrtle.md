# Myrtle

![Myrtle](/img/myrtled-out.JPG)

## Early life and ancestry
Myrtle (born 2009) is a Himalayan rag doll cat. Humane Society volunteers estimated that Myrtle had been living on the streets for several years at the time of her capture, a hardship exacerbated by her being declawed on all fours. Myrtle was adopted by Claire from the Humane Society in 2014.

## Personal life
Myrtle was an only cat for several months until her sister Trudy was brought home. She's moved many times and has shared her space with many people, including Samantha and Kell. In 2021, a crocheted sofa was commissioned for her as a move-in present by Kell and entered in the Creative Arts competition at the Minnesota State Fair where it went on to win 4th place.

Myrtle is the house supervisor, and recognizes the *pop up* command to beckon her when you're sitting on the sofa. She comes alive when her green ogre head toy is thrown around. She frequently greets Claire and Kell when they arrive home. Despite years living outside, Myrtle loves to roam the patio in warmer months and savor the bouquet of smells found in the wild.

## Controversies

### Handling
Myrtle will crab at you when picked up.

### Familial relations
Myrtle does not get along with Trudy (her sister), and often eats Trudy's food.

### Reputation
Myrtle is a misunderstood cat because she's been **deeply** hurt by people in her past. Her anxiety and caution are totally understandable, but with time she reveals her heart of gold.
