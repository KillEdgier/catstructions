# Myrtle

![Myrtle](/img/myrtled-out.JPG)

## Early life and ancestry
Myrtle (born 2009) is a Himalayan rag doll cat. Humane Society volunteers estimated that Myrtle had been living on the streets for several years at the time of her capture, a hardship exacerbated by her being declawed on all fours.

## Personal life
Myrtle was adopted by Claire in 2014 when she lived near Lake Bde Maka Ska. She was an only cat for several months until her sister Trudy was brought home. From Minneapolis, she moved with Claire to Minnetonka, then to Plymouth where she also lived with Samantha Espitia (née Spalding). Myrtle moved again to Champlin in 2018. In early 2021 Myrtle spent three months in Arden Hills with Kell, Claire, and Kell's parents while her home was renovated. Afterwards, her adopted father Kell moved into Château Chanders. In summer 2021, Kelsey created Myrtle's signature sofa.

## Controversies

### Bathroom protest
Starting in 2021, Myrtle stopped defecating in litter boxes
