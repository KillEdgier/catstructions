# Dirty Work

## Litter Boxes
- There are two litter boxes in the house, one on each floor:
    - Rear entry next to the bathroom (downstairs)
    - Office (upstairs)
- Once per visit, please scoop them out (scoop hanging in a white plastic bag in the closet and in the litter tub, respectively) and place the soiled goop in the silver trash can. 
    - Thereâ€™s a new bag underneath the current one in the silver trash can, and even more of them hanging in the pantry and office closet.
- If the bag fills up, please (and thank you) deposit it in the garbage bin with the black lid in the garage.


## Myrtle is Special
:::danger Turds

Myrtle prefers to shit directly on the god damned floor

:::

- There are Clorox wipes underneath the kitchen sink (downstairs) and next to the new litter tub (upstairs) to deal with messes.
- Myrtle has a delicate digestive system and barfs regularly, something her vet has diagnosed as "sometimes cats are just like that."
