# Dirty Work

## Litter Boxes
- There are three litter boxes on the top floor:
    - Two in the den
    - One in the laundry room
- Once per visit, please scoop them out (scoop in the litter tub in the den) and place the soiled goop in the silver trash can. 
    - Thereâ€™s a new bag underneath the current one in the silver trash can, and even more of them hanging in the office closet.
- If the bag fills up, please (and thank you) deposit it in the garbage bin with the black lid in the garage.


## Myrtle is Special
:::danger Turds

Myrtle prefers to shit directly on the god damned floor

:::

- There are Clorox wipes, sanitizing spray, and paper towels in the office to deal with messes.
- She's gross, what can I say
