# Kitty Prozac

:::info New for 2024

We (re)started Myrtle's Prozac regimen to help her Feel Better, and it's been a smashing success.

:::

## The Meds
- Myrtle's Prozac Penâ„¢ is on the third shelf up in the cabinet to the left of the microwave.
- Dispensing is easy! Twist the bottom of the pen until it clicks once.

## Dose Her
:::tip Food Bribe

We have employed classical conditioning techniques to have Myrtle associate medication with mealtime. To make her Extra Compliant, get some food ready before you medicate her.
:::

- Once you've got a dose prepped with the pen, pretend you're drawing and make some lines on the inside of Myrtle's ear.
