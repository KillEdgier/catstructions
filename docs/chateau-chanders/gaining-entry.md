# Gaining Entry

## Front Door
- If you have a housekey, you are very Special.
- If you don't already have a housekey, there'll be a lockbox hanging on the front doorknob with a super secret combination that only you and I know.
- *New for 2025!* We have a Yale lock that is programmed with the same super secret lockbox combination that only you and I know.
    - **Unlock** the door: Summon the keypad by pressing the Yale button, enter the PIN, then press the blue check âœ“
    - **Lock** the door: Press the Yale button to lock. If it sounds like the deadbolt isn't engaging, *push* the door (away from you) and try again.

## Garage Door
- The keypad currently does not work, so the only way to open and close the garage door is from inside the garage.
