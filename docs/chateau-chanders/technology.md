## Wi-Fi

## Google Home
- Our house is named **Live Mas** in Google Home. If you don't have access to it, please ask Claire or Kell for an invite.
- Lighting in several rooms is controlled with Google Home voice commands or with the Google Home app:
    - Living room
    - Dining room
    - Upstairs hallway
    - Den
    - Bedroom
- Thermostat is also connected to Google Home, if you're staying for an extended period of time please adjust to your liking. If you forget to change it back, we can always change it from out of town.

## AV
- The TV and soundbar are programmed to be turned on simultaneously with the power button of the remote control.
- Controlling the volume of the soundbar can be done on the television remote control.
- Streaming services can be summoned by pressing the home button (üè†) on the remote control.
- To change inputs for the PlayStation, Xbox, or Switch, press the inputs button on the remote (nice).
- You don't even want to tangle with the record player. It's the worst.
