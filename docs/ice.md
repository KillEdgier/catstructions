# In Case of Emergency

- Trudy and Myrtle are patients of [Champlin Park Pet Hospital](https://g.co/kgs/hSjtJj).
- [Allied Veterinary Service](https://g.co/kgs/8fwp8U) in Brooklyn Park is open 24/7 for true emergencies. We brought Trudy there and had a positive experience.
    - [BluePearl Pet Hospital](https://g.co/kgs/qCkh7w) in Arden Hills is their veterinarian's recommendation for emergencies, but wait times and prices were exponentially higher than Allied Veterinary Service. Including this as a backup option.
- Pet carriers are stored in the garage on the shelf that hugs the ceiling.
